This is a development of a new elaborating typing algorithm for Downen and Ariola's System D.
All the language work is done in Racket's Redex, a domain-specific language for designing and
testing programming languages. The typing algorithm is presented as set of mutually-defined,
executable elaboration judgments. Because computational sequent calculi are less well-known,
and because the typing algorithm is a bit nontraditional, there is an accompanying document,
written in Racket's Scribble document language, in which System D is introduced, and the typing
algorithm explained.
